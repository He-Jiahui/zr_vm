# ExecIR model and ownership boundary

The first ExecIR model lives in
[`zr_vm_core/include/zr_vm_core/exec_ir.h`](../../zr_vm_core/include/zr_vm_core/exec_ir.h).
Core owns scalar IDs, opcode metadata, ranges, lifecycle, structural checks,
and deep cloning.  Parser construction is declared separately in
`zr_vm_parser/include/zr_vm_parser/exec_ir_builder.h`; the core header does
not include parser AST or the private AOT ExecIR header.

IDs are function-local and start at one.  Zero is the explicit invalid
sentinel; block one is reserved for an explicitly flagged entry block.  The
instruction, operand, result, phi, predecessor, successor, source, deopt, and
GC collections are module/function-owned side arrays.  Instructions contain
indices and stable tokens only, never runtime pointers or host addresses.

`exec_ir_opcode.def` is the single opcode schema source for the enum and
metadata table.  It records operand bounds, terminator/value flags, and effect
classes for arithmetic, place, memory, call, allocation, ownership/drop,
control-flow, exception, suspension, and phi operations.

`ZrCore_ExecIr_CloneModule` and `ZrCore_ExecIr_CloneFunction` build a temporary
deep copy and publish it only after every side-array allocation succeeds.
Module clone rollback includes the function currently being copied, even if a
later side-array copy fails after earlier arrays have allocated storage; the
previous destination remains published. `ssa_core_model` exercises this with
two source functions, an invalid instruction pool in the second function, and
a pre-existing destination. GCC AddressSanitizer with leak detection caught
the partial-function leak before the rollback fix and reports no leak after it.
Structural validation reports the first unknown opcode, invalid range, block,
or value with a stable diagnostic identity.  This slice is intentionally not
the default compiler path yet; SSA construction and projections consume it in
the following M1 tasks.

The direct reference execution boundary is documented separately in
[`execir-oracle-memory.md`](execir-oracle-memory.md). Its memory callback is
caller-owned and deterministic, as is the pointer-free allocation callback;
neither boundary is represented as a host-pointer field inside ExecIR.
